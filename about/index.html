      <h1>Making philanthropy work</h1>
      <p>
        At Stoa, we want to help you find the right grants ‍We know your
        struggles well. Non profits, individuals, and businesses spend too much
        time on grants. Too much effort searching, too much human resources
        applying, too many months waiting to hear back. We’re given complicated
        application forms that aren’t centralized anywhere, and in existing
        grant databases, the information we’re looking for is paywalled, messy
        to sift through, or just poorly designed. The time we’re spending on
        repetitive grant applications should be used to further our mission. ‍
        That’s why we created Stoa, so finding the right grants for you can be
        easy, transparent, understandable — and free. In the Stoa Directory, you
        can search for grants by topic areas and organizations, and sort for the
        newest grants or upcoming deadlines. Whether you’re working to find new
        solutions to climate change, or empowering youth in the community,
        there’s a grant out there for you.

      <h1>Let’s build tools to make philanthropy work, together</h1>
      <p>
        The world has evolved. Issues like climate change, racial reform, and
        public health pandemics have risen to the forefront of our minds, and
        technologies like mobile apps, collaboration software, and machine
        learning are weaved into everyday products we rely on. Yet, the
        philanthropy system has remained relatively unchanged. The burden of
        securing funding is still heavily on the changemakers on the ground and
        in our communities, and the majority of foundations are still working by
        themselves in their siloed networks. We believe good software can help
        the philanthropy world collaborate together.  If you’re a foundation,
        non-profit, individual, or business working to make a social impact,
        we’d love your experiences to inform our journey. Fill out this short
        form. If you’d like to lend a hand, please send us a note.
      </p>

      <p>We’d love for you to join us on our journey:</p>
