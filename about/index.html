      <h1>Find grants made for you</h1>
      <h5>
        We know your struggles well. Non-profits, individuals, and businesses
        spend too much time on grants. Too much effort searching, too much human
        resources applying, too many months waiting to hear back. We’re given
        complicated application forms that aren’t centralized anywhere, and in
        existing grant databases, the information we’re looking for is
        paywalled, messy to sift through, or just poorly designed. The time
        we’re spending on repetitive grant applications should be used to
        further our mission.
      </h5>
      <h5>
        That’s why we created Stoa, so finding the right funding can be easy,
        transparent, understandable — and free. In the Grants Directory, you can
        search for grants by topic areas and organizations, and sort for the
        newest grants or upcoming deadlines. Whether you’re working to find new
        solutions to climate change, or empowering youth in your local
        community, there’s a grant out there for you. 
      </h5>
      <h1>Stoa, building tools for philanthropy</h1>
      <h5>
        The world has evolved. Issues like climate change, racial reform, and
        public health pandemics have risen to the forefront of our minds, and
        technologies like mobile apps, cloud computing, and communication APIs
        are weaved into everyday products we rely on. Yet, the philanthropy
        system has remained relatively unchanged. The burden of securing funding
        is still heavily on the changemakers on the ground and in our
        communities, and the majority of foundations are still working by
        themselves in their siloed networks. We're dedicated to building tools
        to help the philanthropy world collaborate together.
      </h5>
      <h5>
        If you’re a foundation, non-profit, individual, or business working to
        make a social impact, we’d love your experiences to inform our journey.
        Fill out this short form. If you’d like to lend a hand, please send us a
        note.
